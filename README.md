# Avocado-Classifier

Avocado's a delicious but a pricer grocery item! It's important to get the best bang for your buck! I've developed a centroid classifier algorithim for avocado prices.
Given the price of an avocado, my python script will guess the region in which the avocado is being retailed in. Find out if the avocado you're about to buy is being
priced fairly for your geographic area!
